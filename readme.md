YouTube HTML5 Chrome Plugin
=========

* Forces YouTube to play videos in HTML5 format.

* Works by replacing every instance of embed tags (used for Flash videos in YouTube) with an equivalent iframe tag that points to the HTML5 version.

* To install, clone the repo, then navigate to chrome://extensions, check "Developer Mode", click "Load Unpacked Extension..." and select the folder.
